A collection of fast, general-purpose immutable data structures.

## Data Structures

All data structures are fully persistent and safe for concurrent use. Unless otherwise noted, time complexities are worst-case (not amortized).

* Stack: Last in, first out. Constant time operations.
* Queue: First in, first out. Constant time operations.
* Ordered Map: Map with in-order iteration. Logarithmic time operations.
